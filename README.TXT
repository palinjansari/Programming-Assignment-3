Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.

1) Diagrams are in the object folders
2) When you add or remove a class from the program
3) When you edit the parameter
4) private instructor tutor;
6) Once it tells you do something
8) No it didn't because it's over the limit  
10) Error: non-static method getValue() cannot be referenced from a static context
11) Error: '.class' expected
13) It would be the maximum number
15) (34 != 33) && ! false and  ! false
16) a && b
17) a || b
18) No it's not
19) No there isn't
20) Not really because "cat" isn't an identified variable in the code
21) Because it's in the constructor
23) You would need to click 60 times
24) NumberDisplay digit = new NumberDisplay(10)
25)
